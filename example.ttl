    dcterms:description "The Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC) follows the development of around 1,700 Indigenous children and their families across urban, regional and remote Australia. It is one of the largest longitudinal studies of Indigenous people worldwide. LSIC aims to improve understanding of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, their families and communities to inform better policy and program development. The study collects information about parenting, family relationships, housing and neighbourhood, childhood education, child and parent health, parental education, employment and income, attitudes and aspirations, as well as culture and community. It includes two groups of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children who were aged 6 to 18 months (B cohort) and 3.5-5 years (K cohort) when the study began in 2008. Data is primarily collected via annual face-to-face interviews with Indigenous interviewers." ;
